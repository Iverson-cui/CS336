# CS336 Spring 2025 Assignment 1: Basics

For a full description of the assignment, see the assignment handout at

If you see any issues with the assignment handout or code, please feel free to
raise a GitHub issue or open a pull request with a fix.

## Setup

### Environment
We manage our environments with `uv` to ensure reproducibility, portability, and ease of use.
Install `uv` [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended), or run `pip install uv`/`brew install uv`.
We recommend reading a bit about managing projects in `uv` [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#managing-dependencies) (you will not regret it!).

You can now run any code in the repo using
```sh
uv run <python_file_path>
```
and the environment will be automatically solved and activated when necessary.

### Run unit tests


```sh
uv run pytest
```

Initially, all tests should fail with `NotImplementedError`s.
To connect your implementation to the tests, complete the
functions in [./tests/adapters.py](./tests/adapters.py).

### Download data
Download the TinyStories data and a subsample of OpenWebText

``` sh
mkdir -p data
cd data

wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories/resolve/main/TinyStoriesV2-GPT4-train.txt
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories/resolve/main/TinyStoriesV2-GPT4-valid.txt

wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanford-cs336/owt-sample/resolve/main/owt_train.txt.gz
gunzip owt_train.txt.gz
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanford-cs336/owt-sample/resolve/main/owt_valid.txt.gz
gunzip owt_valid.txt.gz

cd ..
```

## My implementation
After getting the data, first thing we need to do is to separate the data, cut it into multiple parts. 
1. generate chunk boundaries for the files based on the parallelism level and number of processes we have.
2. segment each chunk into multiple parts based on <endoftext> token. <endoftext> should be seen as a single token and not be merged with other tokens. We identify it, separate the text and strip it.

Next, we do pre-tokenization. We have a dictionary keeping the frequency of each pre-tokenized string.

Then, based on the pre-tokenization dictionary, we generate frequencies of different byte pairs and get the most frequent byte pair which is also the next merge pair.

We finally merge the most frequent byte pair in the original text and update the pre-tokenization dictionary accordingly. 

Merging $n$ times is done by loop.
